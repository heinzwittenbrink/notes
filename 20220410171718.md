15.6.8.2 Nature-based solutions including REDD+ 1 Nature-based solutions are ‘actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural or modified 2 ecosystems that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human 3 well-being and biodiversity benefits (Cohen-Shacham et al. 2016)‘. Nature-based solutions consist of a 4 wide range of measures including ecosystem-based mitigation and adaptation. 5 The studies on the investment and finance for the nature-based solutions is still limited. However, 6 framework and schemes to incentivise the implementation of nature-based solutions, such as reducing 7 emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and the role of conservation, sustainable 8 management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries (REDD+), 9 which contributes to the climate change mitigation has been actively discussed under the UNFCCC, 10 with lessons from finance for REDD+ being available. 11 If effectively implemented, nature-based solutions can be cost-effective measures and able to provide 12 multiple benefits, such as enhanced climate resilience, enhanced climate change mitigation, biodiversity 13 habitat, water filtration, soil health, and amenity values (Griscom et al. 2017; Keesstra et al. 2018; 14 OECD 2019d; Griscom et al. 2020; Dasgupta 2021) (high confidence). 15 The nature-based solutions have large potential to address climate change and other sustainable 16 development issues (high confidence). Nature-based solutions are undercapitalised and the limited 17 investment and finance, especially limited private capital is widely recognised as one of the main 18 barriers to the implementation and monitoring of the nature-based solutions (Seddon et al. 2020; 19 Toxopeus and Polzin 2021; UNEP et al. 2021) Finance and investment models that generates its own 20 revenues or consistently saves costs are necessary to reduce dependency on grants (Schäfer et al. 2019; 21 Wamsler et al. 2020).
