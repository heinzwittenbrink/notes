> Even so, we can begin to see the outlines of a theory of governance applying to systems characterized by high levels of functional interdependence. These social-ecological systems are highly dynamic, a condition that puts a premium on the development of monitoring procedures capable of providing continuous and timely feedback regarding changes (e.g., shifts from one domain of attraction to another) and on making use of adaptive processes that can help maintain resilience in the face of change (141, 142). Such systems often feature tipping points. Crossing a specific threshold may trigger nonlinear and rapid changes, so it is important to anticipate these disproportionate changes and to respond quickly whenever possible (143).
