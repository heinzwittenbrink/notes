> Sufficiency interventions do not consume energy during the use phase of buildings and do not 31 require maintenance nor replacement over the lifetime of buildings. Density, compacity, 32 bioclimatic design to optimise the use of nature-based solutions, multi-functionality of space through 33 shared space and to allow for adjusting the size of buildings to the evolving needs of households, 34 circular use of materials and repurposing unused existing buildings to avoid using virgin materials, 35 optimisation of the use of buildings through lifestyle changes, use of the thermal mass of buildings to 36 reduce thermal needs, moving from ownership to usership of appliances are among the sufficiency 37 interventions implemented in leading municipalities (high confidence). At a global level, up to 17% of 38 the mitigation potential in the buildings sector could be captured by 2050 through sufficiency 39 interventions (medium confidence).
