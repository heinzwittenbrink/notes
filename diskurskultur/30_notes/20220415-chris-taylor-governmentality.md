> The governmentality of climate change These discourses, including the construction of global risk, have made climate change an object of knowledge that can be governed or managed in specific ways (Rutherford 1999). An ensemble of institutions, descriptions, procedures, calculations and tactics, has been formed to address the problems posed by climate change, resulting in specific and complex forms of power â€“ in short, following Foucault, a governmentality (Foucault 2007; 2008). The activities of the state have increasingly taken the form of endeavours to shape, guide and direct conduct (Rose 1999: 3; Hindess 1996: 108). The most prominent and influential form of governmentality regarding the object of climate change is at the international level, where national governments around the world have formed institutional structures in which to address the object of climate change.
