# XR-Aktion zum G7-Gipfel in Brighton 

Snoro@mastodon.social - Extinction Rebellion leave placards around historical landmarks in Brighton

It read: “G7 seem to be as empty-headed as a statue in the face of a climate emergency.”

“No justice without debt cancellation. Africa emits two per cent of world emissions but is the most vulnerable continent to climate change caused by the most wealthy countries’ consumption levels.”
