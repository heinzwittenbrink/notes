Geteiltes Wissen spielt eine große Rolle für eine klimagerechte Entscheidungsfindung. Nash und Steurer weisen darauf hin, dass an der schwedischen Klimagesetzgebung Beteiligten eine knowledge base benutzten, um auf dem gleichen Wissensstand zu sein. [@nashClimateChangeActs2021, S.9]

> The politicians were joined by invited experts and stakeholder representatives, with work beginning with collective knowledge building. This created a shared knowledge base, ‘giving everybody the same background’, where the committee tried to ‘gather as much information as possible’ (Interview S5) that has been described as one of the committee’s ‘key successes’ (Interview S3), ensuring that all members had the same level of knowledge to input into policy discussions and where the politicians ‘really listened’ (Interview S7). The long timeframe of committee work provided time for members to absorb new information: ‘it took the time it needed’ (Interview S2). The group had monthly meetings, including participation from industry, NGOs and experts who were ‘there all the time’, with NGOs and experts reminding politicians and the industry of ‘the actual facts, so this knowledge-based process actually gave the politicians courage [...] to be able to take a fairly brave step’ (Interview S6). The meetings have been described as ‘workshop style consensus building rather than just plain negotiation’ (Interview S5), ‘mutual learning’ and a ‘trust making’ process (Interview S4): ‘during the process politicians and representatives of different industry bodies were sort of tackling the question together’ (Interview S4)
