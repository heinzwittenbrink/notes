## BETONICUS

2020

This project deals with the warehouses of the Croatian National Theater in Split. Imaginary theatrical show Betonicus is inspired by the fact that neo-historical elements represent other era’s styles. Betonicus, the concrete neo-antique column that exists in generic tourist apartment, dreams about his role of an authentic and antique column that was erected by the emperor Diocletian himself.

Another crucial character of the imagined play is Plasticus, a plastic doors which representsa _subtle_ devastation of historic city centres across the Croatian coast. The set design of the play Betonicus shows the scenographic extension of the Peristyle, the central square of the Diocletian’s Palace in Split, which was conceived as the location of the play’s premiere.

## FACADE

2018

In 1931, at the Beaux-Arts Ball in New York, famous architects dressed as buildings they designed, celebrating contemporary and future architecture during the swing of the Great Depression. As a tribute to this event, I made my own version of an architectural costume. I referred to the amateur and often illegally built private houses in Dalmatia. These houses are colorful, abundant with mass produced industrial statues, false historical decorative elements and plastic windows and doors.

Enjoying the role of a facade that is the thin borderline between private and public space, sometimes I dominate the untouched nature and sometimes I try to fit into the already built landscape.


## VILLA ROZA PROJECT

2016

Ceremonial wedding cake cutting is connected to the illegal houses via aesthetics of excessive sweetness, sentimentality and megalomaniac approach, and finally ends with remnants of insatiability and gluttony. Those remnants evoke ruins of new illegal housing which are sometimes being violently and determinedly demolished by the governmental authorities, but are on the other hand more so often legalized during last few years, and only extreme examples are listed for demolition while majority of such houses remain. Such housing exteriors are usually castle–inspired and are painted in gender connoted pink hue, and as such bring dysfunction at the very image of the house as a patriarchal symbol.
