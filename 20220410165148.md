> Urban green and blue infrastructure—a subset of nature-based solutions (NBS)—acts as both climate 8 mitigation and adaptation measures by reducing heat stress (Kim and Coseo 2018; Privitera and La 9 Rosa 2018; Herath et al. 2021) improving air quality, reducing noise (Scholz et al. 2018; De la Sota et 10 al. 2019), improving urban biodiversity (Hall et al. 2017b), and enhancing well-being, including 11 contributions to local development (Lwasa et al. 2015). Health benefits from urban forestry and green 12 infrastructure include reduced cardiovascular morbidity, improved mental health (van den Bosch and 13 Ode Sang 2017; Vujcic et al. 2017; Al-Kindi et al. 2020; Sharifi et al. 2021), raised birth weight 14 (Dzhambov et al. 2014), and increased life expectancy (Jonker et al. 2014). Urban agriculture, including 15 urban orchards, roof-top gardens, and vertical farming contribute to enhancing food security and 16 fostering healthier diets (Cole et al. 2018; Petit-Boix and Apul 2018; De la Sota et al. 2019) (see Section 17 8.4.4, Figure 8.18, and Box 8.2).
