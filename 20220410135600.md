# [Holmes Rolston - Natural Environment - Brian Williams](https://www.briangwilliams.us/natural-environment/holmes-rolston-iii-1.html)

> Strict duties cannot be derived directly from values, including intrinsic values, because an intermediate premise is needed in which the duty is asserted as an obligation to promote the good or prevent the harm. Instead of being a theory about non-consequential duties, Rolston's theory seems to be a consequentialism in which the general obligation is the obligation to produce good

> Systemic value does not prohibit instrumental use of the component parts, provided the health and integrity of the system are not threatened. 

> In addition, natural organic evolution is projective in value in the sense that the values are captured and carried forward in time, producing increases both (a) in numbers (quantity) of individuals and species, and (b) in complexity (quality) of the forms of life.7

> Rolston rejects the anthropocentric view that ecology is merely enlightened and expanded human self-interest

> there is no firm boundary between what is essentially human and what is essentially ecosystem

> Denying the is-ought fallacy, Rolston argues for a naturalistic ethic in which morality—including both values and duties—is derivative from the holistic character of the ecosystem

> use a term favoured by Rolston, the value that emerges at the evolutionary ecosystem level is 'systemic

> contrast, extinctions caused by humans are dead ends destroying diversity, producing monocultures and shutting down evolutio

> Moral value is attributed to the natural environment considered as an ecological-systemic whole, independent of humans and human interests, except insofar as humans are naturally part of the whole. In contrast, anthropocentric-humanistic approaches treat ecosystems as resource values to be exploited for human ends. 

> Our duties include preserving not only species but entire ecosystems. This is because, unless preserved in situ in their ecosystems, species will not be preserved and evolution will halt.

> The system as a whole captures lower intrinsic values and qualitatively enhances them, thereby exceeding the net sum of their individual intrinsic values.

In support of his notion of natural

> Echoing Leopold, Rolston maintains that normatively right actions—our duties—are those actions that preserve ecosystemic beauty, stability and integrity. P

> egoism becomes 'ecoism

> Except for human intrusions that shut down evolutionary progress, values are enhanced and increased in nature.
