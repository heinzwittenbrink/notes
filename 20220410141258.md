# Polarized communication

> The climate crisis is a wicked problem

<https://www.iss.europa.eu/sites/default/files/EUISSFiles/Alert_52_Climate_change.pdf>

**Climate communication is a wicked problem, too**

One reason may be polarization



## Questions for discussion:

1. Do we make it more difficult to achieve the goals of the climate movement through polarisation?
2. Can we communicate in a radical and non-polarising way at the same time?
3. How do we "frame" our specific communication?

## Climate as a politicized topic

## Polarization and propaganda

## Polarization and personal communication



### Alternatives

- Framing of effectiveness
- Emphasis on consensus of science and accuracy (not direction)
- Personally relevant, nearby/local issues
- Public health
- Credibility of ambassadors, diversity
- Personal credibility, *spirituality*



## Scientific consensus and polarized political positions


[The US News Media, Polarization on Climate Change, and Pathways to Effective Communication: Environmental Communication: Vol 12, No 2](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17524032.2017.1397039 "The US News Media, Polarization on Climate Change, and Pathways to Effective Communication: Environmental Communication: Vol 12, No 2")

> The Internet itself offers an entirely new vehicle for news communication (Brainard, 2015), as traditional media outlets continue to shift away from presenting reports on climate change and rely increasingly more on online blog posters and “advocacy journalists” to present information in a dramatic context and thus distort the climate change risks (Nisbet & Fahy, 2015). This is exemplified by the very different semantics employed in online postsrelative to traditional journalism, particularly so with regard to climate change

**Priorization of global heating: at the bottom level**

>  First, it is not obvious how one can get the public to attend to scientific information about climate change given the number of other priorities competing for an individual’s limited and selective attention (Druckman, 2015; Lupia, 2013).

**Party-political framing of climate issues as "left-wing**

> This leads to a second challenge facing climate science communicators: public opinion about the existence and causes of climate change is sharply divided along partisan and ideological lines in the U.S., which generates protective forms of information acquisition and processing (Kahan, 2015; McCright & Dunlap, 2011).

**Factual (half-)knwoledge often supports denialists' position**

> Even more troublingly, as partisans become more factually knowledgeable, or scientifically literate, they become more likely to discount information that challenges their existing identities and values (Bolsen, Druckman, & Cook, 2015; Kahan, 2015).

**Homogenity of online networks**

> Using a nationally representative sample of the American public, Hart, Feldman, Leiserowitz, and Maibach (2015) established the relationship between the homogeneity of one’s online network and the degree to which the discussion that occurs in that network is polarizing. 

**Search for information can lead into echo chambers**

> Thus, **the unobstructed pursuit of information in new media is likely resulting in the creation of echo chambers, increased polarization, and politicized discussions among the public.**

**Problem of doomism**

- Separated from agency
- Distance and feeled/perceived scientific insecurity/doubts



> Therefore, democratic policy-makers face strong incentives to adopt policies preferred by the majority of voters” (p.1). In the face of the challenges mentioned immediately above, science communication scholars have begun to explore strategies to overcome these hurdles including: (1) choosing frames that resonate and promote efficacy with target audiences; (2) highlighting the existence of a scientific consensus and widespread agreement among experts over the fundamentals of climate science; (3) promoting accuracy goals (rather than directional goals) among citizens when processing new scientific information; and (4) recruiting credible messengers and spokespersons for diverse audiences. A

> Consequently, recent work has begun to explore how frames that **target the perceived efficacy** of action on climate change shape individuals’ beliefs and actions in this domain (Hart & Feldman, 2016a, 2016b). 

> This suggests that images and frames in communication that generate a sense of positive self efficacy will ultimately generate engagement and support for action on climate change.

> Other work explores messages most likely to affectively engage diverse audiencesby highlighting personally relevant and near-term effects.

> Interestingly, the results showed that the public health frame increased perceptions of hope among subsets of the population mostly likely to be skeptical about climate change,

> A number of studies suggest that communicating the existence of a scientific consensus about human-caused climate change shifts the public’s belief toward the scientific consensus 

> Although communicating the existence of a scientific consensus can lead citizens to shift their opinions in the direction of that information, the precise impact depends on the political context in which that information is encountered

> Moreover, the positive impact of communicating the scientific consensus information among low knowledge partisans is eliminated when politicization – i.e., a frame highlighting the inherent uncertainty of science employed to cast doubt on scientific consensus – is introduced into the communicative context

> n other words, partisans support or oppose an identical policy based on whether it was endorsed by Democrats or Republicans, but this tendency is eliminated when an accuracy processing motivation is effectively induced.

> Scannell and Gifford (2013), for example, found that frames that accentuate the local impacts that will result from climate change cause individuals to become more engaged and seek out information (also see, Lu & Chadwick,2015; Spence & Pidgeon, 2010). 

**Credibility:** One solution isto bring together scientists and communicators who hold varied sets of values and ideological leanings to communicate consensus about fundamental science when it exists.

> “… once community members from differing political backgrounds join together to achieve a broadly inspiring goal like protecting people and a local way of life, then the networks of trust and collaborations formed can be used to move this diverse segment toward cooperation in pursuit of national policy goals.” 

> To expand on the previous point, persuasion does not occur unless a listener perceives both expertise and shared interest (Druckman, 2015; Lupia, 2013), and it is thuscrucial to find credible voices that speak to broad segments of the U.S. population. 

> s this paper’s final strategy to shift public support about climate change, engagement by the scientific community is arguably the most important, drawing together individuals from disparate communities and with disparate ideologies and values to create both an entirely new communication medium as well as an elevated level of climate change-related discourse to counter the frequently invoked political conflict and false balance of climate change in the news media.




>  the challenges facing communicators seeking to foster consensus among the U.S. public necessary for policy action, which include understanding how to: increase theimportance of climate change as a priority; overcome partisan divisions regarding the fundamentals of climate science; effectively combat instances in which actors politicize climate science; and, overcome obstacles posed by selective attention and the perceived distal nature of impacts resulting from climate chang

At the same time, Republican consultant Frank Luntz recommended in a strategy memo to lobbyists and members of Congress that the climate change issue be framed as scientifically uncertain and that the U.S. be described as bearing an unfair economic “burden” in the absence of international coordination. 

> The political conflict frame was simultaneously supplemented with the continued presence of the uncertain science frame. 

>  The balance in reporting about theclimate change “debate” continued through the late 1990s and early 2000s. By giving equal time to the scientific consensus and uncertain science frames, media coverage validated – or at least helped enable – the efforts of a minority of contrarian scientific voices

> A defining feature of the disaster frame commonly found in science-policy debatesis that there is a looming catastrophe unless action is taken immediately. An unintended consequence of this frame is that it plays into the hands of climate skeptics who have castthis rhetoric as “alarmism” and motivated by partisan and ideological agendas (Nisbet, 2009).

**Gore-Kampagne wurde als politisch wahrgenommen**

> ]y 2008, Bush’s last year in office, Gore’s efforts had helped boost belief [in climate change] among Democrats to 76% while belief among Republicans remained virtually unchangedat 41%” (p. 65). Ultimately, Gore’s advocacy and efforts to mobilize public action on climate change and the associated media coverage highlighting political conflict frames helped lay the foundation for all subsequent and continuing partisan divisions among the American public regarding climate change

> They also coded for the presence of the following emphasis frames: environment, public health, national security, economic consequences, morality/ethics, and political conflict. The results demonstrate that TV news rarely discussed both the impacts likely to result from climate change alongside frames highlighting actions to address the problem.

It shows that asymmetric polarization precedes the emergence of the internet and that even today the internet is highly unlikely to be the main cause of polarization, by comparison to Fox News and talk radio.

Looking at eight different measures used across political science to measure partisan polarization, and at data ranging back to 1972, they found that most of the polarization that has happened since 1996, the first year for which there is regularly collected data on internet use, occurred in the populations least likely to be internet connected (those aged 65 and over), while polarization of those most likely to be online and use social media has been fairly stable over this period.94

"... As a first step, I look for polarising tendencies in myself. So I have to muster enough courage to feel the sense of vulnerability in the face of my own neuroses and persevere with it without breaking down or hiding. When I honestly look for polarisation in myself, I find a lot of intransigence and seeing the problem in others. I find that I often see others as adversaries who have only faults - in contrast to my own faultlessness. It has often been pointed out to me that I have such habits, but unless I look closer, I don't recognise them.

„… In einem ersten Schritt suche ich nach Polarisierungstendenzen in mir selbst. Ich muss also genug Mut aufbringen, um das Gefühl der Verletzlichkeit angesichts meiner eigenen Neurosen zu spüren und damit standhaft auszuharren, ohne zusammenzubrechen oder mich zu verstecken. Wenn ich ehrlich nach Polarisierung in mir selbst suche, finde ich eine Menge Unnachgiebigkeit und Das-Problem-bei-den-anderen-Sehen. Ich stelle fest, dass ich andere oft als Gegner betrachte, die nur Fehler haben – im Gegensatz zu meiner eigenen Fehlerlosigkeit. Oft hat man mich schon darauf aufmerksam gemacht, dass ich solche Gewohnheiten habe, aber wenn ich nicht näher hinsehe, erkenne ich sie nicht.

### Courage
Having brought my own habits into focus, I awaken in myself a strong desire to do all I can to stop adding polarisation to the world. This enables me to put my actions into a larger context. I no longer react reflexively to what annoys me. Once I have awakened this aspiration in myself, I can more easily use an antidote to the unpleasant feeling that wants to push me towards polarisation ...

Mut
Nachdem ich meine eigenen Gewohnheiten in den Fokus gerückt habe, wecke ich in mir das starke Bestreben, alles zu tun, um der Welt keine weitere Polarisierung mehr hinzuzufügen. So kann ich meine Handlungen in einen größeren Zusammenhang stellen. Ich reagiere nicht mehr reflexartig auf das, was mich ärgert. Sobald ich dieses Bestreben in mir geweckt habe, kann ich leichter ein Gegenmittel gegen das unangenehme Gefühl einsetzen, das mich in Richtung Polarisierung drängen will …

> Wenn zum Beispiel von einer "Flüchtlingsflut" oder von "Asyltourismus" gesprochen wird, dann werden ganz bestimmte Bilder hervorgerufen. Die Sprachbilder werden nicht verwendet, um etwas differenziert darzustellen, sondern nur, um zu polarisieren.
