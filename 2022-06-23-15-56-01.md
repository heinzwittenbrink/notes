Ausführlicher Überblicksartikel über den amerikanischen Philosophen Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò [@thomasonOlufemiTaiwoTheory2022], der wohl vor allem als Theoretiker der Klimagerechtigkeit interssant ist. Dabei schließt er kritisch an John Rawls an. Zu Anfange weist John Tomason auch darauf hin, dass angesichts des Klimanotstands die europäische Geschichte neu gedacht werden muss. Táíwò schreibt über Implikationen des Gerechtigkeitskonzept, die Rawls nicht thematisiert, weil er eine auf Nationalstaaten und die jeweilige Gegenwart beschränkte Perspektive hat (wenn man diesem Artikel folgt).

Ein anderer und viel konkreterer Ansatz als der von Stephen M. Gardiner [z.B. -@gardinerPerfectMoralStorm2006] – mit dem er aber verwandt ist, weil auch bei Táíwò die Dimensionen der Klimagerechtigkeit die Dimensionen aller anderen ethischen Probleme sprengen. (Als weitere Position, die ich noch weniger kenne, notiere ich Holmes Rolston [@williamsHolmesRolstonNatural2021].)

Gut gefällt mir die Idee, dass sich Philosophie vor allem mit *background assumptions* beschäftigt. Táíwò greift die *background assumptions* einer Klimapolitik und -ethik angreift, die nicht von der durch den Kolonialismus und die auf ihn folgende Globalisierung erzeugten Ungerechtigkeit ausgeht. 

Táíwò argumentiert für #Bürgerinnenräte.

> History may create the constraints and boundaries within which people make choices, but they still make choices. The more those boundaries are expanded, the more actions that are available to people, Táíwò’s argument goes.


> Debt justice and enhanced climate finance should help build a platform for countries in the Global South to achieve low-carbon development and robust, resilient infrastructure.”


> he co-authored a report documenting the ways that the U.S. and other rich countries could immediately restructure or cancel debt owed by poor countries as a first step in a program of climate reparations.


> He recently teamed up with three other academics to publish a proposal outlining the possibility of a publicly owned, democratically controlled carbon removal authority in the U.S., which could be modeled after municipal water or trash systems, or regional electric cooperatives.


> New International Economic Order that Ghana, Nigeria, and dozens of other decolonized countries demanded of the United Nations in the 1970s.


> On the local scale, he’s spoken approvingly of citizen assemblies in contrast to the mass electoral politics we normally associate with democracy.


> Because the colonial world order remains a force in people’s lives, a reparations project that achieves justice cannot simply compensate for past and present damages — it must be what Táíwò calls a “worldmaking project,” concerning itself not just with wealth and resource distribution but with building and maintaining environments that allow everybody to flourish within them. In this sense, he considers his project a “constructive” approach to reparations.


> Much of this sounds familiar, or at least intuitive, to those immersed in the rhetoric of the environmental justice movement. It’s all connected. But Táíwò provides a grand unified theory that explains why it’s all connected, and points to ways of remaking the world in accordance with philosophical principles of justice.


> Taken together, these disparities make formerly colonized countries most vulnerable to the ravages of climate change — an ironic outcome, given that their late industrialization makes them least responsible for climate change in the first place. 


> Second, Táíwò argues that Rawls proposed a “snapshot view” of justice: It establishes what a just set of outcomes would be at a single point in time, failing to recognize that circumstances today were often created in the past — and that what looks like justice to people alive today may harm their grandchildren. Building


> Táíwò thinks Rawls’ famous theory of justice is wrong on multiple counts. The first is its focus on states.


> Táíwò’s ambition is no less than Aristotle’s when the latter sat down to spell out exactly how to live the good life.


> Táíwò’s dissertation advisor, the philosopher AJ Julius, described their time together as the “uncommon experience of watching someone in permanent revolution.”


> “I just figured philosophy was the place you went to think about background assumptions.”


> These experiences informed a principle at the core of Táíwò’s philosophical viewpoint: that justice is a question of how both resources and personal security are distributed between different countries and communities as well as within them.


> “elite capture” of justice-oriented projects.


> “Treating group elites’ interests as necessarily or even presumptively aligned with full group interests involves a political naiveté we cannot afford,” he writes.


> This paradox is at the core of Táíwò’s argument about the perils of a certain kind of identity politics, an argument he makes in a recent essay that became his latest book, Elite Capture, published in May: Identifying a single person who can accurately and fully represent the voices of a marginalized group is easier said than done.


> Táíwò thinks this approach might make sense if we all lived in completely autonomous countries with representative and functional governments. But we don’t. Given this, Táíwò argues that we cannot pursue justice without recognizing that we live in an interconnected world that distributes risks and benefits in profoundly unequal ways, regardless of what any of the 193 members of the United Nations might want. This



> Rawls argued that justice consists of whatever principles all of a society’s members would agree to if they were to assume what he called a “veil of ignorance” — in other words, if they did not know the exact circumstances under which they would live.

  

> While Táíwò’s ultimate vision is of a world where economic and political power is massively redistributed, it’s clear that he thinks rapid decarbonization is the world’s most immediate priority



> If political purity gets in the way of improving the actual life experience of people now and in the future, then it has no place in his account of justice.

     

> that carbon removal is an essential tactic in the pursuit of environmental justice

  

> “Are any of these other measures that we take toward racial justice going to have staying power in a world that’s 3 degrees hotter?” he has said. “In a world where there is rampant instability in our energy and housing systems? In a world of mass human displacement? In a world where the elites of the world feel very threatened?”

    

> each additional degree of global warming seemed to undermine the good that any reparations project could do.

      

> A 32-year-old assistant professor, he’s already one of the country’s most publicly prominent philosophers, and he’s certainly the most vocal philosopher working on issues related to climate chang
