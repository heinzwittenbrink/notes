tuxom@mastodon.social - I am disgusted: new record profits for Total

I’m deeply sickened by yesterday’s announcement: the oil giant #Total announced to its #shareholders a profit of 5.7 billion dollars in the second quarter. Their triumphant declaration of these profits highlights the moral bankruptcy and the danger that the #FossilFuel giants present to all of us.
